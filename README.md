An android app that shows the user's location using the MVVM design pattern using Google Maps SDK

## Background

Develop a demo Mobile app, using the Huawei Map Kit and Location Kit SDK:

● When the user opens the app, it should locate the user's current location and
show on the Huawei Map.

● Mark the user's current location on the Map with a star/marker, and pop up the
user's current address when they click the star/marker - show the address
description not the Geocoding value.

● User can move and click on the map, and the marker will move to the point as the
user clicks - popup the address description when the user pins a point on the
map.

## Note

For obvious security reasons, I have restricted the maps API key to the debug version of my app only.
